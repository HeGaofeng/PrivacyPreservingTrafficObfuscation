# PrivacyPreservingTrafficObfuscation

This is the code described in "A Developer-Friendly Library for Smart Home IoT Privacy-Preserving Traffic Obfuscation" 
published at IoT S&P'18: ACM SIGCOMM 2018 Workshop on IoT Security and Privacy , August 20, 2018, Budapest, Hungary. 
The paper and an in-depth description of the library can be found here: <link>

This library is meant to be used by IoT developers to obfuscate the traffic sent by their devices. 
By "obfuscation", we meant that attackers should not be able to look at the shape  of traffic
and determine when a user is using the device.

We offer two solutions for different kinds of devices.
